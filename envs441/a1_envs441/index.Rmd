# Introduction

**Where Do Ethno-Linguistic Groups Meet? How Copresence during Free-Time Is Related to Copresence at Home and at Work**

**Toomet, O. et al. (2015)**
--

- Analyses ethnic segregation in Tallin, Estonia

- Estonian majority with a mainly Russian speaking minority

- Looks at segregation in work, places of residence, and free time

- Mobile phone data used to track segregation

---
# Methods Overview

- Language spoken determined through phone SIM settings

- 'Call Detail Records' used, tracks time and location when a call or text made

- When individuals made a call or text in a shared location, at a particular time, this was considered to be co-presence

- Home and work locations inferred from the most frequent location during home and work hours

- Free time activities were determined through proximity to work and home locations

--

$$p _ { i j } = \sum \mathbb { 1 } \left( c _ { j k } \in C _ { i } \right)$$


$$h _ { i } = \frac { s _ { i } } { s _ { i } + d _ { i } }$$


$$h _ { i } ^ { F } = \alpha _ { 0 } + \overline { \alpha } _ { 1 } \overline { h } _ { i } ^ { R } + \alpha _ { 1 } \rho _ { i } + \overline { \alpha } _ { 2 } \overline { h } _ { i } ^ { W } + \alpha _ { 2 } \omega _ { i } + \beta ^ { \prime } \boldsymbol { X } _ { i } + \epsilon _ { i }$$

# Results

df <- read.csv(file="data.csv")
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
knitr::kable(df, format = "html") %>% 
              add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Place by type (%)" = 4,"Homophily (%) by place" = 2))

```

Work and Home dissimilarity Index: $(DF^W = 0.46)$ and $(DF^R = 0.41)$.

Free-time Dissimilarity Index: $$(DF^F = 0.24)$$


--

1. Highest levels of meetings observed at home

2. Higher similarity (meaning segregation) at home and work

3. Free time mixing higher, especially in the city centre

# Critique

- Using mobile phone data allows for a large amount of quantitative data to be analysed

- Due to how co-presence is calculated, it more accurately represents the potential for people to meet within a one hour time-frame rather than co-presence

- The affects of co-presence are not considered. Does co prescence lead to improved interactions between groups, or does it increase hostility?


###*"More research is needed here." (Toomet, O. et al., 2015).*

# Mixed Methods

**Bagheri, N. (2014). Mapping women in Tehran’s public spaces: a geo-visualization perspective.**

**Peters, K., & de Haan, H. (2011). Everyday spaces of inter-ethnic interaction: The meaning of urban public spaces in the Netherlands.**

- How does observed co-presence relate to the public opinion of ethnic divide.

- Incorporate Quantitative GIS (QGIS) methods to produce a mixed methodology

- Qualitative data to compliment the quantitative data

- Directed interview questioning to determine public opinion on the level of co-presence
