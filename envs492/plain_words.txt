 usage in the United Kingdom has been steadily increasing by year with the highest ever billion vehicle miles travelled in BVM;][]{departmentfortransport. Characterised by tall hedgerows and winding turns, rural roads in the UK are often unsuitable for higher traffic flow due to the obstruction of view from protected hedgerows, narrow lanes and often poor condition Due to the abundance of these roads, with "Unclassified" local network roads making up The Rural Urban Classification defines a rural area as one outside of a settlement with more than a  resident population therefore a road could be considered rural, if either connecting or present within small settlements in the UK. This study will focus particularly on rural connecting roads, outside of rural towns. The purpose of this is to select roads that are unlit, and are unlikely to have been individually assessed, as opposed to roads that are present within more built up rural areas. These roads are considered to likely have the designated national speed limit of mph, and feature hedgerows, narrow road surfaces, and bends, key features to be considered in this dissertation.  A Governmental review of speed policy considered the need for the role of speed and accidents on rural roads to be further addressed suggesting a framework for individual classification of roads, taking into account local considerations of the road to implement more suitable speed limits. In  draft guidance for rural roads was presented by the Department for Transport suggesting a blanket reduction in rural single carriageway road speed limits from ph to ph and a reduction to ph for lower quality A and B roads However, this draft guidance has yet to be implemented, likely due to the costs involved in a blanket change to speed limits. For example, the cost for a complete change in national speed limits from imperial to metric in Ireland cost an estimated â‚¬million in speed limit signs alone These costs suggest that an alternative to blanket implementation may be required.  National speed limits have seen little variation for a number of years, with the majority of roads following the broad criteria for the three main roads types. The three national speed limits are: the mph speed limit on roads with street lighting (sometimes referred to as Restricted Roads) the national speed limit of mph on single carriageway roads the national speed limit of mph on dual carriageways and motorways. The  outline, in that national speed limits are not appropriate for all roads, where local road conditions present the requirement for alternative speed limits. The majority of the rural road network in the UK follows the national speed limit of ph for single carriageway roads, and ph for dual carriageway roads, despite driver speed often being far below the speed limit. The  note that this is especially common on C and Unclassified roads due to the narrow width, frequent bends, junctions and access roads. In  an estimated The  suggest that selecting alternative speed limits for single carriageway rural roads should consider: History of collisions; The road's function; Existing mean traffic speed; Use by vulnerable road users; The road's geometry and function; and the road environment, including roadside development. The Road Safety Management Capacity Review  outlines the current limitations with road safety management, with the lack of defined and measurable safety performance framework, noting that such a framework should set out the long term goal of total prevention of road deaths and injuries, achieving this through a reduction in average speeds on different road types, and an improvement in emergency response times. This review states that at present there is a distinct lack of both urban and rural road hierarchies, which could be used to better match appropriate speed limits, with function, layout and design. Again, this review notes that posted speed limits often allow for speed far in excess of the design limits of single carriageway rural roads, with inappropriate but allowable speed often a contributing factor in rural accidents. Finally the report calls for a review of national speed limits as soon as possible.  A recent development for guidance in setting local speed limits is the production of the This tool provides an automated method for the introduction of new speed limits for local councils. This tool takes observed traffic flow, accidents, speeds, descriptive information regarding the network and current costs, outputting projections in these data to advise speed limit changes. While this tool introduces a quantitative method for individual road speed limit assessments, it misses some key features outlined in past government framework proposals [e.g.][]{departmentfortransport, particularly in relation to road geometry.  The innovative methodology presented in this dissertation will focus particularly on the call for an improved understanding of rural road geometry to support the production of appropriate and justified speed limits for rural single carriageway roads, and to inform future requirements for a full rural road hierarchy. Road geometry is defined here as the parameters of roads relating to geometric design, particularly relating to the appropriate road speed, stopping sight distance, road width, road bends and surface quality Some road geometric information may be extracted through the readily available OS Road centreline geometries. However, the extraction of road widths poses a complication as this information is not readily available, and automated extraction requires techniques that enable road classification through the data available, either aerial imagery, or LiDAR. Road classification techniques have more recently been aided through the introduction of LiDAR data, as an alternative to aerial imagery classification, allowing for more reliable results due to the presence of additional information that LiDAR provides. The following section outlines LiDAR in this context, and presents how LiDAR may be used to extract these features of roads. Aerial LiDAR data is collected by emitting rapid laser pulses from an aircraft towards the ground which are reflected back, measuring the distance between the aircraft and surface objects at up to  measurements per second This method produces a set of highly accurate three dimensional points which collectively are known as a LiDAR point As LiDAR data detects all surface objects, the resultant point cloud produced will include all natural and man made structures, including buildings, roads and trees in addition to the natural variation in the terrain height, known as a digital surface model The main features unique to LiDAR, unlike similar aerial data collection techniques such as true colour imagery are outlined below: Pulses: LiDAR systems record the data by emitting a laser pulse which is reflected back at the aircraft by ground objects. If the laser hits a solid object such as ground or a building roof, this laser pulse is entirely reflected back towards the aircraft, giving a single point. However, if the laser pulse hits a soft object such as a tree canopy, the pulse may be partially returned, giving multiple return pulses Therefore, these multiple pulse returns give information regarding objects at an exact  location but with varying heights. Intensity: LiDAR systems also give intensity values for return pulses, which gives information regarding the reflectance of the surface of objects that are hit by the laser pulses. If intensity is given  then reflectance  may be represented as  where  refers to the first pulse signal intensity Elevation: In addition to  and  coordinates, the distance between the aircraft and the reflected ground or object is recorded and assigned a  value. Rural roads in the UK are often characterised by dense hedgerows either side, with large trees that extend over the road surface. In addition to the reduction in corner visibility on these roads, standard aerial imagery suffers from the road surface being obscured by shadows from these trees and hedgerows, and the tree canopy itself. Additionally, aerial imagery often suffers from obstruction due to clouds Due to the inclusion of pulses with modern LiDAR data, the road surface can often be detected through the canopy by selecting the final pulse returns, the infrared laser pulses also have smaller shadows, due to the narrow scanning angle of LiDAR Non LiDAR imagery often suffers from scene complexity, where road patterns, vehicles and lane markings reduce road heterogeneity The value information provided by LiDAR data allows for the separation of ground and objects on the surface, meaning roads and buildings are often easily separated, despite having similar reflectance Additionally, the reflectance of roads is often homogeneous, and distinctly separate from vegetation LiDAR lacks any texture or spectral information, and often studies in road classification have combined LiDAR with aerial imagery to alleviate this issue with the inclusion of luminescence information to aid with road classification [e.g.][]{charaniya. LiDAR points are distributed irregularly and with varying density, with point density often higher where flight strips overlap, and tall objects can occlude points, leaving more limited data surrounding trees or buildings Often road classification methodologies use LiDAR height data to identify kerbs to separate streets from pavement however rural roads often have no kerb, and are often at the same level as the surrounding vegetation LiDAR data often requires a large amount of processing due to the irregular distribution of points, presence of noise and the number of variables that have to be considered.  note that often papers do not include information regarding the computational time for processing this data which may cause practical limitations at larger scales. This dissertation will present a method for rural road classification and width extraction for a m region in the North West of England (Figure The methodology is produced in order to ensure scalability and automation, allowing for replication for any area where data is available. Data used will include road centreline geometries, LiDAR point cloud, and aerial imagery to extract road widths through linear probability models. Additionally, this dissertation aims to extract other features of roads such as elevation changes, surface quality, and the sharpness of bends. The extraction of such features aims to build upon past road classification studies, combined with a more refined methodology that aims to ensure a higher accuracy for rural British roads. Unlike previous road classification methodologies, this dissertation aims to focus primarily on road feature extraction, and not the accurate extraction of road locations, as road centerline locations provided by Ordnance Survey already exists. Using OS Road and LiDAR Data produce an automated method for determining the characteristics of rural roads that relate to overall road quality. These are; Bend sharpness Road steepness Surface quality Road width Produce and assess an automated method using LiDAR, aerial imagery and OS road geometry to determine the true width of roads within the chosen study area, outlining the particular limitations and solutions when considering the rural British road network. Using extracted road features, outline the overall quality of the road network, and allow for direct comparison between each road. This dissertation is organised into chapters, first a literature review, outlining the broad implications of speed limits, rural road networks, and object extraction particularly in relation to LiDAR aerial point clouds. Second, a detailed description of the methodology involved in this dissertation will outline the techniques used to classify road widths, in addition to the other road geometric information. A results section will primarily assess the method for road classification, through sensitivity analysis and some qualitative observations, a section will then explore the findings. Finally a discussion will detail the implications of the findings, and suggest areas for methodological improvement. road classification techniques have focused purely on urban road networks and involved methods which can be both computationally intensive and time consuming. Given the pressure for a full quantitative assessment of the current speed limits for the rural road network in the United Kingdom, there is a demand to produce comprehensive methods for rural road feature extraction that may be applied nationally. This paper primarily focuses on techniques for assessing the road geometry for roads considered to be rural connecting roads in the United Kingdom. This literature review will first outline the current understanding of the rural road network, considering the role of speed and speed limits in accident likelihood, and a detailed look at current road extraction techniques involving aerial imagery and LiDAR, presenting the key differences and limitations of these studies when considering the rural road network in the UK. conducted a study outlining the key features of British rural roads, in an effort to improve the understanding of the characteristics associated with accident rates, beyond the past  (MASTER) study which primarily consisted of European road data, with limited data for England identify key features of selected rural British roads across England which they use to classify roads into certain categories. This data was obtained through drivethrough video recordings.  Features that  suggest to consider in an analysis of British rural roads are given on Table This study manually measured the road width for each site, and to determine the "hilliness" of roads, the number of  contour lines crossed were counted to give the total change in height. categorised these roads into four key groups: Group  Roads which are very hilly, with a high bend density and low traffic speed. Group  Roads with a high access density, above average bend density and below average traffic speed. Group  Roads with a high junction density, but below average bend density and hilliness, and above average traffic speed. Group  Roads with a low density of bends, junctions and accesses and a high traffic speed. This study therefore attempted to outline a rural road hierarchy in relation to road function, and certain road geometries, which addresses issues outlined in the Government's review of speed policy However, due to the nature of the data collection for this study, time constraints mean that producing a full road hierarchy for all rural roads within England using this methodology is impractical. An observation of single carriageway rural roads in England found that the distribution of mean speeds was wide, and often significantly below the ph limit Accidents on rural roads often occur within the mph speed limit meaning a distinction between what is an appropriate speed should be made that does not relate to a given speed limit.  suggest a distinction between both  and  speed.  when driving above the speed limit, and therefore directly breaking the law;  speed, when driving too fast for the conditions of the road, not necessarily above the speed limit, often considered dangerous driving. A study by the  assessed the impact of inappropriate speed on rural roads, which contributed to The Department for Transport found that rural roads account for around Lowering the speed limit on roads has been shown to result in an overall reduction in the average speed of vehicles.  found that a reduction in the speed limit of a road resulted in a mean speed reduction of around one quarter of the difference, noting that drivers will often obey speed limits that they determine to be reasonable. A reduction in average speed subsequently leads to a reduction in road traffic accidents produced a model to predict accident frequencies given the proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limit and the average speed, finding that excess speed and a higher speed limit were both associated with a higher accident frequency.  Particularly, the risk of death at various speeds has been assessed in various studies,  found that at ph the risk of a driver dying in a head on collision between two cars is around demonstrated that traffic flow, link length, and the number of minor junctions all directly increased the number of accidents, while wider roads were associated with a reduction in the number of accidents. The assessed road geometry and other features of rural roads in Europe, however road data for the United Kingdom was limited to a small area in the South East, suggesting that a comprehensive methodology for the extraction of UK rural road geometry is required for a more comprehensive study.  Newer developments like the Speed Limit Appraisal Tool mean that automated and quantitatively informed speed limits may be imposed on rural roads. However, this tool does not take into account key features such as road geometry, and simply builds on existing speed data and accidents Aerial LiDAR classification typically follows two objectives, the classification of ground and nonground points, and the classification of surface objects, including buildings, trees or roads Classification takes two forms,  and supervised classification taking a  dataset, and using it to estimate the parameters associated with the outcome hoping to be classified. These parameters are then used on unknown data, with a similar distribution to the training set, and used to classify features Early LiDAR classification primarily focused on the production of digital terrain models (DTM) [e.g.][]{krausmaaselberink, by segmenting vegetation, and man made structures from ground. This dissertation will utilise a recent method for DTM production in order to classify ground and non ground points for subsequent road classification. The method chosen was proposed by  using  to generate a DTM from LiDAR data. This algorithm, unlike other filtering algorithms, allows for a simplistic input, without the need for numerous parameters to ensure an accurate DTM. This method consists of four main steps: A simulated is placed above the inverted LiDAR measurements. A series of points that lie flat to the surface and are allowed to move based on the influence of gravity. The displacement of each LiDAR point is calculated under the influence of gravity, meaning some points appear below ground measurements. For any points detected as being under the ground, they are moved to ground level and set to be unmovable. Movable points are moved according to neighbouring points. Quantitative accuracy assessment of this methodology by  gave results similar to top existing DTM production algorithms, but with a far more simplistic implementation, and reduced computation times. Developments in LiDAR enabled the possibility of classification beyond ground and nonground, by using laser intensity information and multiple returns, features of more advanced LiDAR systems. The TopEye system used by  allowed for classification of buildings and electrical powerlines using reflectance to obtain radiometric information about the area and note that this can be used to separate paved area from grassland. Power lines in particular benefited from the multiple returns produced by the LiDAR system used as they often gave one return from the power line, and one from ground.  Vegetation in particular exhibits multiple returns, whereas most man made surface objects do not. By considering the number of returns and homogeneous height variation  were able to categorise surface vegetation into both high vegetation, low vegetation as well as smooth man made surfaces. In comparison to the extraction of vegetation and buildings from LiDAR, the extraction of roads poses far more of a challenge, due to there being less prominent height differences Road classification is essentially a data clustering method to categorise data into road and nonroad points, enabled through discovering patterns and relationships between variables and validation of findings Clustering may be achieved through various algorithms, categorised generally into partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, densitybased methods, gridbased methods, and modelbased methods note that the periodic assessment of roads is important due to the changing traffic load, which is generally increasing over time, and new automated techniques will enable this in areas where in the past it had not been feasible. Due to the heterogeneous nature of certain roads types, the road environment is often complex, meaning collection and accurate processing of road features is challenging Road classification methodologies have historically used purely aerial imagery, providing only road pixels and  location information Such techniques rely solely on image texture analysis of the coloured pixels and appear to be focused entirely in urban settings. Additionally, the methods proposed in aerial image classification fail to address the differentiation between road and pavement, simply classifying building and nonbuilding, rather than roads. Intensity, elevation and the inclusion of multiple returns in LiDAR data enabled methods for categorising roads, and differentiating them from the surrounding ground, despite the similar elevation The majority of current road classification techniques using LiDAR have focused on unsupervised classification, often with the goal in vehicle automation using mobile LiDAR data [e.g.][]{yadavkumarsmadjajaakkola, and applications using aerial LiDAR have also followed this trend for unsupervised classification Many methods for road classification from LiDAR follow similar patterns, first identification of ground points through height data, then DTM extraction through interpolation, followed by classification based on the attributes of the point cloud produced a methodology using mobile LiDAR data to classify road edges by segmenting kerbstones based on the height gradient along the scanned profile. However, this mobile LiDAR classification required driving speeds of m h to m h, and lengthy computation times. Additionally noted by  in a similar study. Ground based LiDAR collection techniques often provide a resolution far higher than aerial LiDAR data, however the time taken for a comprehensive coverage of all British rural roads would not allow for its use in a national road assessment.  Other unsupervised road classification techniques rely on the detection of planar or smooth surfaces at ground level, indicative of man made objects which, unlike vegetation, do not display sharp variation in height values used both aerial imagery and LiDAR data in combination with a training dataset to classify urban roads. The training dataset gave human labelled features, and used to train a maximum likelihood classification model.  extracted roads from LiDAR using a Supportvector Machine (SVM) classification. Training samples enabled classification into roads, trees, buildings, grassland and cement. Accuracy was determined through testing on three known road datasets, the number of LiDAR points correctly categorised ranged from These supervised techniques give insight into the feasibility for rural road extraction, given a dataset of known road centrelines. With improvements to the quality of LiDAR data more recently, a methodology for road feature extraction using road centrelines and LiDAR may more comprehensively include features that distinguish roads from surrounding objects, including intensity, the number of returns, and aerial luminescence. Many recent road extraction techniques have relied on the segmentation between roads and buildings, relying on a clear height difference between road and nonroad surfaces a feature uncommon to rural roads. Rural road classification therefore must rely on alternative features of roads, notably the difference in intensity produced by vegetation compared with the surface of man made objects, explored in various studies [e.g.][]{vosselman. Additionally, overhanging tree canopies are uncommon features of roads that have been previously classified, and as such, a methodology for classifying rural British roads must take this limitation into particular consideration. This dissertation aims to extract key features of a selection of rural roads in England through a combination of LiDAR point clouds, OS open road geometries, and aerial imagery, selecting road features considered to be important in past literature and government reviews. The key features considered when determining road quality are; Width: Narrower roads are associated with an increased number of accidents in many studies of rural roads Surface quality: Poor quality road surfaces have been shown to increase the number of road traffic accidents Blind corners winding roads: Blind corners increase the risk of accidents, and higher speeds mean stopping distances are often above the distance visible around rural road corners in the UK. Blind corners are particularly an issue due to the tall hedgerows that often bank rural roads Road Steepness: Steeper roads have an increased skid risk, and their quality is more likely to deteriorate While the focus of past road classification methods typically aim to classify the entire road surface, this isn't necessary for the feature extraction of roads as proposed in this dissertation. To extract roads widths, only LiDAR points at each edge of the road surface are required, and points along the road surface may be sampled at regular intervals, removing the majority of unnecessary LiDAR points and improving computation time, often a key limitation when working with LiDAR data Additionally, this paper aims to concentrate on a supervised classification of roads, by taking known centreline locations, many LiDAR points may be excluded, and remaining points concentrated towards the centre of the centrelines may be used as a training data set. Unlike road widths, other road features do not require classification with the inclusion of known road geometries. Road bends may be determined through the existing road linestrings, while surface quality and road steepness may be extracted at known road locations in the LiDAR point cloud. The method as presented aims to allow for the potential expansion beyond the dataset considered in this analysis, providing the requisite data is available. dissertation primarily makes use of the free open source statistical language Managing the large LiDAR datasets from my personal computer was made possible through the package Further details regarding the  environment and computer setup used for this dissertation are given in Appendix Also given in Appendix  are the code snippets utilised in this methodology, for many equations, the relevant code is given as a reference to the appendix location, in the form A.x.x.

The total number of LiDAR points used in this study is All LiDAR data has a vertical accuracy of m Root mean square error (RMSE). An overview of the LiDAR data selected for this study is given on Table The variables of primary interest are: z: The distance a laser pulse is reflected back to to scanner, calculated by the time taken for a return pulse to be detected. Intensity: The amplitude of the return pulse, reflected back by the surface terrain or objects. ReturnNumber: A number of range  indicating for a point, the corresponding order of a reflected laser pulse. A return number of indicates the first return for a pulse (and highest  value), a return number of indicates the last return (and lowest  value). NumberOfReturns: The number of return pulses for a single laser pulse (maximum of Classification: A number given to a point indicating a specific numeric classification. Of interest in this study is a classification of  indicating a ground point. More information is given by which outlines numerical classifications for various vegetation types and man made structures. The LiDAR point cloud data used in this paper gives the values for pulse returns. The canopy above roads may be excluded through ignoring early pulses (higher Z values), therefore only the last pulse values for any point are selected, taking only points where the ReturnNumber equals the NumberOfReturns. Last pulse points may be expressed as; where  is a single instance of a LiDAR point within the chosen point cloud,  is the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate, and  the last pulse intensity value. Ground points were classified using the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm, as described in Points were already classified in the data provided, however, as the classification technique was unknown, reclassification was considered necessary. The general implementation simulates the movements of a piece of cloth lying over the inverse of a point cloud, as the point cloud is flipped, the cloth settles beneath ground points, while covering points that lie separate to the ground, essentially forming a digital terrain model (DTM), cloth simulations are described in more detail in  and subsection The CSF algorithm is given; where is the mass of a single LiDAR point (set to is the time step between points and  represents the gravity constant. The implementation of this algorithm was given as part of the  package. Reclassification resulted in an increase in the number of classified ground points by With the classification of ground points, (given a full DTM may be produced through spatial interpolation of the classified points.  Interpolation uses the inverse distance weighting and  nearest neighbours algorithms to produce the DTM. Nearest neighbours were selected as with  for the inverse weighting, and used to produce a DTM with a resolution of This particular technique was selected over more comprehensive methods such as kriging as the number of points is very high, and the small benefit of kriging was considered minimal compared with the increase in computational load. The  values from the DTM were then subtracted from the LiDAR point cloud, leaving a normalised point cloud. This ensures that when extracting height information, any observed values are due to objects on the surface of the terrain, and not due to the lie of the terrain itself. With the normalised last pulse point cloud, the point cloud was clipped to within a  extent of each known road location, using the OS road shapefiles; where  are the geometric areas of each road in the study area. Selecting a  extent ensured that even with slight inaccuracy in road location, the road LiDAR points would likely not be excluded. A large number of unimportant points were therefore removed, saving on computational resources. Additionally this extent ensured that both road and non road points were included, but reduced the chance of false positives from occurring as fewer non road points were now included in the analysis. Intensity noise was filtered through area based outlier detection, measuring the h percentile values within a  area, and removing all points above the where  represents a  selection of LiDAR points, where each point  has an intensity value within the As mentioned in Section objects of class  enabled more efficient processing by allowing the LiDAR point cloud to be processed in predefined batch sizes. Considering a collection of processed LiDAR points; last pulse, normalised, clipped to  road extents, and intensity noise filtered. Points were then grouped into  areas; and each area collectively represents the overall processed point cloud; The preprocessed LiDAR data was combined with the OS road shapefiles and aerial imagery to obtain a set of criteria to assess the chosen road network. A summary of the information provided alongside OS road shapefiles is given on Table While both  and  do provide true road identification for many roads, this was not true for each road in the area chosen. Due to this, it was impossible to identify what could be considered an individual road, meaning a  will now be defined as indicated on Figure selected based on the shapefile geometry provided.

All roads are single carriageway, and so for the purpose of this analysis it is assumed they likely have the default national speed limit of ph. All  were removed, as were roads with a length of less than often those clipped by the extent of the LiDAR data. The angle of each bend in a road was identified through the nodes produced in the creation of the road shapefiles. First the road linestrings were split into points, with coordinates representing each node within a road, a point at which the orientation of the linestring is altered, (See Figure  and  for illustrations of road nodes).  The direction of a road was considered to be the from a node  to a node with the angle measured in a clockwise direction from north. This is represented on Figure To find the angle the node  can be represented into relation to node  as; where  is the length of the line segment Rearranging the equation for  gives; this equation can be rewritten to calculate the value of  using the  function; finally the bearing angle  may be obtained by the addition of to any value below With the bearing angle of the first line segment for a particular road, the change in orientation of the second  line segment between nodes  and  may be given; or simply written as with additional nodes following the pattern Figure  illustrates this for nodes to  indicating the bearing angle  in relation to the bearing angle rather than in relation to the north As the bearing angle between the first two nodes gives only the initial direction of the road, this was set to zero; In the final analysis, for each road the maximum bearing angle between any two nodes was selected, as well as the average bearing angle between all nodes. The elevation change between two road node points was calculated by first selecting nonnormalised LiDAR points at a geometric node within a  area. LiDAR points were then filtered by those only classified as ground, and with only a single return, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate  values from canopy or other vegetation and vehicles. The mean  value of points were found for each node, and elevation change between each node was calculated; where  are the  values for ground classified points with a single return, and  is the change in elevation between sequential nodes  and taking the change in mean single return pulse point  values within a  buffer of each node. For each road, the total elevation change per kilometer was calculated by dividing the sum of all elevation changes between two neighbouring road nodes by the length of a road in kilometers; where  is the length of a road  in meters. Surface quality was assessed through the range in intensity values found at a  area around each road node. Again, to ensure there was no inaccuracy in intensity values caused by later returns passing through a canopy, only points that had a single return pulse and classified as ground were used in this analysis; where  represents LiDAR point intensities with a single pulse return and ground classified, and  represents each individual intensity value for each node in a road, giving the range The LiDAR point cloud was sampled at  by  bounding regions, at regular meter intervals for each road, perpendicular to the road direction, ensuring that when road direction changed, the sampling locations remained perpendicular. To achieve this, each road was first split into nodes at which road direction changed, with a single road consisting of multiple nodes with  coordinates, indicating a point along a road where the road direction changed. From this, points with  coordinates were created at meter intervals beginning at the start of a road, (considered Node until the next node along the road To calculate these points along each line between two neighbouring nodes and first the individual change in  and  values was calculated, expressed as; along with the euclidean distance between these nodes; A point along these two nodes, at an interval distance was determined through these equations; giving a point  at a distance  from  in the direction of Where  is the increment, which increases by  until the length of the node is covered, given  and To create a perpendicular sample from a point  at position  between two nodes  and first two points at a perpendicular distance  from the bearing angle between the two nodes, at a point  were created, with  selected as First the euclidean distance from  to the point  was calculated; with this distance, the value required for each  coordinate to achieve a distance of  from a point  may be calculated by; then to create perpendicular points at length  from the point the value  was added to the  value of the point while the value  was subtracted from the  value of the point This was then inverted to produce a second point. This may be expressed as; where  is a collection of two points at distance  from the point From these two points, a linestring was created between them, which was then buffered to This gave sample lines, with an area of  by at  intervals along each road. The total point cloud was then clipped to only include points with fell inside these sample lines With the perpendicular sample lines extracted for the length of every road, to assist with the prediction of correct road locations, true colour aerial imagery was included. This imagery was first converted from three band RGB raster images, to a singleband greyscale raster brick with values ranging to  Combining the three bands into a single band produces a grey scale image, that more accurately portrays luminescence information from the aerial image, which has been included in past road classification methodologies. For a supervised classification of roads, first the outcome variable  was estimated by classifying all points within a  buffer of the known road centrelines as road, and all points outside this as nonroad. To further classify road and nonroad, linear models were constructed in relation to this outcome variable, and compared to assess effectiveness. A maximal approach was chosen, selecting all appropriate predictor variables, iterating through models by removing variables that did not significantly influence the model outcome, or created noise.  In addition to the variables provided by the LiDAR and aerial data, the variable  was created and included, representing the shortest distance from a point to the centreline of the road it is associated with, considering that road points should be weighted more towards points that are closer to the centrepoint of the road.  Linear probability models essentially follow the same formula as a linear regression model: but given a binary outcome variable this is considered to be a linear probability model, taking the form; where; therefore may be interpreted as the change in the probability that with all other predictor variable constant.  may be estimated using Ordinary Least Squares regression Likelihood values from the predictions gave a range of numerical values to Points that fell below a certain threshold were removed, leaving only points that were most likely correctly identified as road points. This threshold was assessed qualitatively through both observation of the distribution of probability ranges for each model, and results gained through different thresholds. Considering a threshold this may be expressed as; where  is the total point cloud and  is the value assigned to a point indicating the likelihood that the point is part of the road surface.  Further qualitative assessment of the results revealed that some points considered to be noise were still present, but often isolated. To ensure no isolated points were present, the minimum distance between each point, and the nearest neighbouring point was checked, if a single point was considered isolated, with over  between it and any other point, it was removed. This may be expressed as; given  is the minimum distance between a point and any other point.  The full point cloud  now gave of a collection of predicted road points for each sample line along a road segment, with noise removed.  To obtain road widths from these points, the maximum distance between two points in a particular sample was determined, these points were kept and all others removed. A linear section of road with two samples resembles Figure To find the angle the difference in  and  coordinates between two nodes  and  was calculated as in Equation  to obtain the bearing angle between these nodes, represented by the grey line on Figure Similarly, the difference in  and  coordinates were found for the perpendicular points associated with the sample. With this,  is given; where the difference in node coordinates gives and the difference in sample line coordinates gives Given the two selected points at every sample with a maximum distance between them, trigonometry could be used to determine the width of the road at that particular location. Road width is considered to be the adjacent line length where  is a single sample location), perpendicular to the road segment, considering the distance between the two points to be the hypotenuse  of a right angled triangle (Figure The width  for each sample location was found, this may be expressed using trigonometry as; where  gives the predicted width of a road at a sample With a complete set of calculated road widths for each sample, any width above  was removed, in addition to any width below under the assumption that a width calculated outside these limits would be caused due to noise or inaccuracy.  There is the possibility that the maximum distance between two points does not provide the maximum perpendicular distance across a road section. Such a situation would arise given a triangle formed that is has an opposite length above the adjacent length giving a hypotenuse with a longer vertical length. However, given the maximum opposite line length between two points in a sample line is (each sample is  by for any line where the opposite length is greater than the adjacent length, the adjacent length must therefore be below  and thus, the road width calculated from this sample is removed during the filtering process. During the analysis of the linear models, it was noted that road centrelines were often inaccurate, giving road outcome values that were not representative of the road surface. In an attempt to adjust for this, new road centrelines were derived based on the centre location of road points in each sample, classified through an initial linear probability model. The mid point between two points  and  can be expressed as; With the mid point of each classified road sample, these were than joined for form new centrelines, and a further linear probability model was ran and compared.  Given the improvement in road centreline locations, it was considered feasible to construct linear probability models individually for each sample location on each road. This technique would allow for per road variation in material type or quality, and potentially reduce the amount of noise brought in from inaccurate centrelines. Preliminary testing of this method revealed that it was essential to remove any sample containing tree canopy, as the predictions were based off points that misrepresented true road points. While points are generally able to penetrate the canopy, the intensity values produces by these points was reduced, and removed the distinction between road intensity values, and vegetation. This analysis of the LiDAR data is described in more detail in Chapter Additionally, due to the reduced number of points, it was considered feasible to filter out points that gave model  values below For each individual model, if the  value of any predictor or the outcome variable road was above the sample location it was associated with was removed in an attempt to improve the reliability of results. This may be expressed as; To aid with model interpretability, the direct comparison between each variable in the analysis was enabled through centering and scaling with the use of beta coefficients QGIS  was used to manually measure the width at various points along each road using m resolution aerial imagery, avoiding stretches of road with canopy cover that obscured the true road width. With the widths, the results of each model was compared to assess model accuracy. Each width was normalised to allow comparison between each road, and to give a final average accuracy value. Normalisation was achieved through finding the relative difference in width as a percentage; where  is the normalised width,  is the average width per road derived from the linear model, and  is the qualitatively estimated width. Given some widths occasionally were overestimated, to ensure the outcome of this calculation gave a relative value, any normalised width given a value above was reassigned; given To provide a method for direct comparison between each road, the extracted features are normalised and combined as one to produce the Road Quality Index (RQI).  Normalisation of each road feature was achieved through a simple range normalisation; where  denotes the minimum of the range of a variable, denotes the maximum of the range of a variable, and  denotes the variable to be scaled. As an increase in road width is associated with a higher quality road, as opposed to larger values of each other variable indicating a poorer quality road, the width values were first inversed before normalisation. An additional variable, reliability was presented in addition to the RQI, which gives a value for the number of points per road length, allowing for some information regarding the density of sample points to be considered in analysis.  Following normalisation, the sum of all normalised variables for a particular road were taken, and subtracted from to give positive values indicating better quality roads, and lower values indicating lower quality roads. These variables involved in the creation of this index are; Road Angles: The bearing angle change in road direction, considering the initial road direction as a bearing angle of (Section Road Elevation Change: The change in elevation for each node in a road, extracted from LiDAR data, giving a total elevation change for a full road (Section Road Surface Quality: The total range of intensity values for each node in a road, extracted from the LiDAR point cloud for points that did not return more than a single pulse (Section Road Width: Extracted through linear probability classification of the road surface using LiDAR data (Section The value obtained from this is referred to as the Road Quality Index, presented in full on Table for the overall methodology are presented in this chapter, covering the initial preprocessing of LiDAR and other data, following onto the width extraction of roads, in addition to other geometric features. The primary goal is to critique the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and provide a baseline for future improvements, particularly in road classification and width extraction, while presenting the quantifiable results in a way that relates to the overall quality of each road. Outlined in detail therefore is sensitivity analysis of the road classification models, presenting both qualitative and quantitative assessments of accuracy. Assessment of improvements made to road centreline locations is also covered, before a detailed look at the final results of the analysis, demonstrating how road feature extraction may inform the overall quality of a road, comparing the extracted data to aerial imagery for a visual assessment of the results.  As noted in Section computation time is considered an important aspect of this analysis. The total time taken, including all data preprocessing, perpendicular sample line extraction, LiDAR sample extraction, construction of linear models, reprocessing of road centrelines, road feature extraction, and further analysis is  minutes. Table  indicates that there are likely some points with noise, particularly reflected by the highest intensity value relative to the standard deviation with Chunk of Following intensity noise filtering, the highest intensity value was now with a standard deviation of Figure  (A) gives the distribution of Intensity values for all points within the study area, showing two clear spikes in intensity, at at value of around  with another around  This is reflected similarly in the Luminescence values, with two peaks at around and (Figure  (B)).  Figure  gives the results of further LiDAR preprocessing, comparing Figure  (A) and Figure  (B), shows how last pulse LiDAR filtering allows for the removal of the majority of tree canopies, leaving only ground points that are considered hard surfaces, and as such are the lowest point the laser pulse has penetrated. Additionally, Figure  (B) shows how a digital terrain model, created through interpolation techniques, using only the base point cloud may be used to normalise the points, giving a digital surface model which only shows the true height of surface objects, without having to consider the variation in lie of the land. However, Figure  (C) indicates that while filtering for last pulse returns may appear to remove much of the canopy, reflected in the  values, the intensity values for points that have penetrated the canopy are lower than those that did not (See the tree just below the centre of the road). This particularly creates issues in the distinction between road and non road in neighbouring areas where the intensity "shadow" created removes the distinct difference in intensity. This suggests that for ground points with multiple returns, the intensity values are likely far less reliable for road classification. Quantitative analysis of this limitation reveals that for ground classified points with a single return the average intensity value is while for ground classified points with multiple returns, the average intensity value is Using the  buffer from known road locations, and sample line extraction, the number of points from the original LiDAR point cloud for the m area was reduced from  to  giving a reduction in number of points by Selected based on literature, and correlation analysis of the variables (See Appendix B, Table the first model was constructed to include all variables of importance from the LiDAR point cloud, Intensity, and Number of Returns. Additionally, luminescence from aerial imagery was included, and the minimum distance of a point from the known road centreline location. This first (maximal) model was constructed as; As proposed in Chapter Section the road outcome variable was given as points that fell within a  buffer of the known road centreline locations. As such, this meant that a fair number of false negative points are expected to have occurred, where points outside  of a road centreline location would be incorrectly classified as nonroad. Due to this, the classification of nonroad and road was not a simple selection of points that were above a Figure  shows that there is a clear separation between the majority of points, and higher probability values. This therefore gives insight into the true divide between true road and nonroad points, allowing for a qualitative analysis to select the most appropriate quantile of probability values. Three quantiles were chosen, the h, h and h, as indicated on Figure Figure  reveals that qualitatively, the optimal choice for a quantile filtering of the linear probability distribution is likely the h quantile (Figure  (A)). However, observation of the southern section of Figure  (A) reveals that inaccurate centreline locations have led to an incomplete linear model analysis. To compensate for this, a further method proposed aims to improve the accuracy of the given road centreline locations. Additionally, Figure  (A) reveals that for the h quantile probability values, shadow from road hedgerows appears to reduce the model accuracy, as noticeable towards the centre of the road. For this reason, a second model was constructed for later comparison, which removes the  information provided by the aerial imagery; To improve road centreline location accuracy, the h quantile results from the first linear probability analysis were used, due to there being a more complete selection of points, but without compromising the true location of roads by including too many outside points.  New road centrelines are given on Figure  (A). Particular improvements are given where the road curves between two open fields, but the original centreline was given as a straight line, covering the hedgerow, and no road surface. Qualitative comparison between the Linear Probability Model based off the original centreline locations reveals an improvement in overall road detection, particularly towards the edge of roads, while additional samples are achieved in areas which previously had no coverage due to the incorrect centreline placement (Figure  (A)). However, it appears that in areas where there are higher levels of linear predictive inaccuracy, the new centrelines are less accurate. Thankfully, noise exclusion techniques employed have removed samples that fall within these areas, particularly noticeable at the northern end of Figure  (C). Figure  also gives information regarding the distance based noise exclusion technique, which has allowed for the exclusion of isolated points accurately on Figure  (B). Improved centreline locations allowed for individual linear models (Figure  (D)). While it was assumed that individual linear models would potentially produce more accurate width estimations, it is hard to differentiate between the global and individual linear models (Figure  (C) and (D)). For direct comparison between the two selected global linear probability models, centering and scaling of the predictor variables allowed for an easier interpretation of results, without affecting any statistical inferences. This was considered necessary as both  values and standard errors produced by global models offered little in terms of interpretability due to the very large number of points involved in this study. Centering and scaling was obtained through the production of beta coefficients with results given on Table The removal of luminescence had little effect on the other predictor coefficients, due to the very small influence of this coefficient, reflected by the normalised value and the qualitative analysis of the issues due to shadows, as such, it was considered an unnecessary addition. The other coefficients all give insight into their influence of the road outcome, for example for every increase in the standard deviation in the likelihood a point is to be a road point decreases by a standard deviation of This therefore suggests that the inclusion of the  coefficient is important, despite not being considered in other supervised road detection techniques.  Table  gives a normalised comparison between each linear model, and its associated estimated road width. This gives insight into the effectiveness of various linear probability models for each road, and road type. While average values all give relative accuracy in the region of data osroads roads.gpkg"{}; The file doesn't seem to exist.}}  {road"{})): object 'road' not found}} {latex"{}, booktabs TRUE, digits object 'norm' not found}}  {begin\{table\}[!b]n\ begin\{minipage\}\{.inewidth\}n\ caption\{Model Coefficients, Comparison between Linear Probability Models and }label\{tab:coeftest\}n\ centering"{}, object 't not found}} As LM  gave the highest mean accuracy for roads (Table it was selected for the final road width predictions. From this, Table  gives the full results of the road geometric extraction, along with an estimate of overall road quality given by the Road Quality Index (RQI). Qualitative assessment of the RQI may be achieved through observation of the highest and lowest values (Figure It appears to produce reliable results, as the road with the highest RQI is straighter and wider than the road with the lowest RQI, and is likely flat given it is neighboured by houses. proposed methodology presents a road classification technique which considers the need for an optimised and efficient extraction of road widths to combine with other road features for use in an automated national rural road assessment. This method builds upon past road classification techniques with the inclusion of Ordinance Survey road centreline geometries allowing for a supervised classification, without the need for the manual and time consuming creation of a training dataset.  While considered to be a supervised method, the training data used in this method is derived from the preexisting OS road centrelines, and as such may be recreated automatically for any road in England, given the comprehensive coverage of this data This differs from existing supervised road classification methods, where a training dataset is created and manually labelled [e.g.][]{charaniya. Additionally, the majority of LiDAR road classification techniques focus on unsupervised methods [e.g.][]{clodevosselmanjaakkoladarmawati, and as such do not consider the use of any training data, with the primary goal of obtaining accurate road locations. Such techniques often limit their scope to road centreline extraction which has a limited use case with a preexisting national road centreline database. Notably,  assess the accuracy of their technique by comparing derived road centrelines to an existing road centreline database which renders little in terms of practical application.  Therefore, the method presented in this dissertation considers a more practical approach, providing an intermediate between unsupervised and supervised methods, which integrates the known road centrelines into the road classification. Rather than attempting to classify road centrelines, or the full road surface, this dissertation concentrates on the requirement for road feature extraction as presented in various UK government rural road studies With the primary focus of road classification on the automated road width extraction. Focusing on solely width extraction enables road surface sampling, primarily enabling a reduction in computational overhead, while adding the benefit of more simplistic noise filtering techniques, and a per road width classification. Direct comparison between the computational efficiency of this method and past methods is not possible due to the unique data used in this study. However,  outline some specifications of the dataset used in their supervised road centreline extraction using LiDAR and aerial imagery. With aerial imagery at a resolution of m, and a total by pixels, the study area therefore covers  by Similar to the m for this study. The total time taken for object extraction for this area in their method was  minutes, compared with the  minutes proposed in this paper. It is expected that the method proposed by  should take far longer to compute due to being the inclusion of complex methodologies such as image segmentation through random forest classification, and without any preliminary removal of LiDAR points such as the  buffer from known road centrelines used in this dissertation. Despite several road classification methodologies proposing the inclusion of aerial imagery to assist with accuracy [e.g.][]{charaniyahuiguan, this study reveals that for roads overlooked by tall features such as hedgerows, the shadow created reduces overall classification accuracy. Additionally, the inclusion of aerial data provided little benefit in areas without shadows, likely due to the more distinct separation in intensity values from a rural road surface and surrounding vegetation, unlike that found in a more urban setting. Due to the irregularity of LiDAR and the large number of points, many past road classification techniques have relied on regulating the data into a grid For example,  used LiDAR with a resolution of m, and regularised this into a grid to produce a DTM and subsequently extract road centrelines. Due to this aggregation, they were able to filter points through a density threshold, and produce road centrelines. However, using this method to find road widths proved more difficult, and as  note; the function that derived road widths in this paper resulted in some ambiguity.  The focus of many road classification techniques are primarily directed towards either centreline extraction or the use of ground based LiDAR for use in automated vehicles and almost all studies appear to focus on urban road classification while even studies considering "rural" areas, do not represent roads that would be found in the context of rural England and exclude key features such as hedgerows, overhanging vegetation, with the road surface appearing fully distinct from neighbouring verges. Additionally these studies do not focus primarily on road width extraction, and as such are limited by the requirement for the inclusion of all points of data, to obtain a full road extraction.  The study of the speed accident relationship on rural British roads by  outlined some techniques for the extraction of rural British road features, and as such was able to begin an assessment for the classification of rural road hierarchies. However, the data collection technique employed included drivethrough video recordings, not allowing for a scalable approach. Results also often lacked in accuracy, taking the road height variation from OS  contour lines. The method proposed in this dissertation aims to alleviate these problems by ensuring a higher level of accuracy in height variation, through the use of LiDAR data with a m RMSE. As well as allowing for a computational technique that does not rely on the manual collection of groundbased data, and instead uses aerial LiDAR which is more practically feasible to obtain for a comprehensive study. LiDAR has multiple use cases, meaning the national production of this data is well funded. Stopping Sight Distances are an important consideration for rural British roads. From qualitative observation of aerial imagery, and personal knowledge, hedgerows that bank the verges either side of many rural British roads often fully obscure the sight line around sharp bends, meaning it is often impossible to see oncoming traffic or obstacles, which, given the nature of these roads can often be large farm vehicles which spill into multiple lanes, or hazards such as farm animals, or unsafe road conditions. It is worth mentioning that the majority of hedgerows have automatic protection under the Hedgerow Regulations  for numerous historic and environmental reasons [e.g. protected species;][]{ukgovernment, as such, their removal for road safety is rarely granted.  Stopping Sight Distance is defined as the ability to see an object in the roadway with enough distance to stop, Table  outlines the calculated stopping sight distances at certain speeds, giving a rough indication of the distance required between a car and bend in a road. For example, Table  indicates that at ph (ph), stopping sight distance is recommended to be Broadly, for a road to be considered appropriate for a ph limit, it could be said that it should not have a bend which impairs the line of sight within  such a speed limit. For a rough idea of the number of bends per road (ignoring bend sharpness), there is an additional table given in Appendix B, Table Assumptions for certain road regulations are made that drivers will slow to appropriate speeds to adapt to road conditions, either in poor weather, or to approach a sharp bend, however  note that often this is not that case, and drivers often do not slow appreciably to account for these conditions. Therefore suggesting that speed limits should more accurately reflect the conditions of the road. Additionally, stopping sight distances observed by  are significantly longer for larger vehicles such as trucks, and given the large farm vehicles often present on country roads, speed policy should take this into account. Road features extracted in this dissertation may be used to inform the current likely stopping sight distances, combining key features such as the width of roads, which influences the sight line, the max bend angle within a road segment, and the elevation change. Transport disadvantage is a key limitation of transport accessibility, that may be due to lack of public transport, a poor road network, or a persons physical inability to reach a destination due to disability Often transport disadvantage may be alleviated through access to public transport, as this removes the requirement for private transport ownership, limited by both income and ability to drive. However, public transport in rural areas is often limited or absent, meaning rural transport predominantly relies on private road vehicles, limiting access for those who are unable to drive, such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities Additionally, this reliance on private transport increases the minimum cost of living in rural communities, given car ownership is often considered mandatory but often isn't taken into account when assessing the minimum cost of living in rural areas For those who are unable to access private transport, accessibility is considered limited through capability, rather than pure accessibility through journey times and other factors Rural areas in particular often have larger elderly populations, meaning capability is often a key issue in areas with poor public transport, and can lead to social exclusion for those without cars Transport accessibility is defined by the UK Government through journey time estimates for populations to particular key services. In particular, the UK Government uses official accessibility indicators to set minimum thresholds for journey time access to education, health services, employment and retail hubs also taking into account the availability of public transport services. Accessibility in rural areas is found to be far poorer than urban areas based off minimum travel times to various services, and while travel by car generally reduces travel times, the rate is still far below urban areas. This journey time data is simplified, giving the start point of journeys as a single point within Output Area census units, and aggregated road speeds. The output of this data is given at the LSOA level which is then used for accessibility analysis. Journey times are obtained through mass collection of GPS data by INRIX  which is then used in TRACC software Due to the limited use of rural roads, the GPS data obtained for speed estimates are likely far less reliable than for urban areas. Additionally, calculating journey time in rural areas should consider the road geometry, which the above method ignores. By considering features such as road width, quality, bends, and elevation change, the suitability of certain roads for particular vehicle types may be informed. For example, rural healthcare accessibility is becoming more of an issue given fewer healthcare professionals now live in rural communities, and the urban centralisation of hospital services  means that understanding the level of access that each rural community has to these services is more important than ever. Emergency vehicles are often far larger than personal transportation, meaning GPS times derived from smaller personal transportation likely does not provide an accurate journey time estimate for these vehicle types, as the geometric features of certain roads likely do not allow for these vehicles. Aggregation and simplification of journey time estimates also do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the true journey times for each rural road, which would be achievable through the road feature extraction presented in this dissertation. The individual rural road features may provide further insight into specific roads which require targeted improvements to alleviate accessibility problems, without suffering from inherent geographical limitations such as the MAUP imposed by journey time aggregation. There is a strong urban bias for the development of new transport technologies explained through key issues particular to rural transport systems; Service area: Rural transport agencies often serve large areas with long trips. As a result, assisting passengers needs is not easy and attending immediately to a problem that arises on the road is difficult (e.g. rescheduling trips when an incident occurs.) Service Coordination: There are different basic public services e.g. healthcare and education with overlapping areas of services. It is challenging to coordinate services and resources among the agencies and other providers. Infrastructure: Rural areas suffer a lack of communication infrastructure e.g. wireless communications services, realtime communication from and to rural passengers. Fleet size: Although tech can solve several transportation problems in remote rural areas, it might be difficult to fund and develop at a small scale. While it may appear that many of these issues are inherent to rural areas, and unsolvable, the optimisation of transport technologies for rural areas may be made more achievable through access to the comprehensive road data provided through the methods proposed in this dissertation.  state that flexible integrated transport services are a likely public transport implementation that would benefit rural areas without the limitations outlined above, such a technology would rely extensively on a full understanding of the road network on which it would be dispatched. The  call for "Unconventional modes" of public transport in such areas, building mainly on a bottom up approach to meet direct demand. Additionally, vehicles supplied through such an implementation would account for suitability to both road conditions and consumer demand, allowing for vehicles smaller than a typical bus for example on narrower roads There is also a significant call for the inclusion of a more comprehensive understanding of the road network through advanced computational techniques to improve the efficiency and quality of existing transport systems including a more flexible transport management system Supply chains rely on a well maintained road infrastructure, and as such, many rural areas are considered to be (economically) "Lagging Rural Regions", due to their geographical remoteness, poor infrastructures, low population density and limited employment opportunities, often supported economically by an agricultural backbone Improving the economy of such areas therefore relies primarily on the effectiveness of the supply chains, often limited due to the poor infrastructures and recent demand for large scale supply chains is limited in these areas due to the overall quality of the road network. To further understand the limitations of rural supply chains inherently relies on a full understanding of the road network, whether to acknowledge where limitations exist, or to develop opportunities for optimisation of the supply chains. Similarly,  call for location analysis of supply chains through quantifiable data, to better optimise supply routes. As results have revealed, it is relatively hard to quantify the accuracy of this particular linear probability analysis, and often the accuracy has been assessed qualitatively. The ultimate goal with this method would be to produce a model which may be assessed quantitatively, allowing for a more conclusive and full automation. It should also be noted that the quantile selection at present is based on a qualitative observation of the distribution of linear probability values for the current m area, and as such it would be essential to find a method to quantitatively assess the cutoff for road and nonroad points in order for this method to be used with other roads.  At present the removal of noise at the final stage of the road classification comes from both identifying isolated points (See Function and the removal of calculated widths that are above  and below  (See Appendix While logically it makes sense to include limitations for widths, given a road below  would not support even single way traffic, and a  road is unexpected for any rural single carriageway, these limitations are still arbitrary, and for all unclassified roads in England, there is no minimum width required Alternatives to Linear Probability models do exist when considering binary outcome variables, one being probabilistic regression, which takes the cumulative standard normal distribution function to model the regression. Interpretability of results may be aided through this method as it includes consideration of the quantiles associated with a unit change in outcome variables. Additionally logistic (and probabilistic) regression, unlike simple linear regression do not take the assumption that there is a linear distribution in the outcome, weighting values more towards or  conforming more with the distribution of a binary outcome variable [See Figure ;][]{hanck. However, preliminary analysis of the methodology in this study did consider a logistic regression, but found that interpretability of the quantiles and results was difficult, and qualitative observation of the results did not appear to provide much benefit over linear regression. Alternative methods to reduce the noise produced in road classification may include the identifications of straight line road edges, a distinguishing feature of man made structures This could enable point exclusion if outside of a particular threshold in relation to other points. LiDAR classification techniques often make use of segmentation algorithms to identify objects from geometric features such as planes, and straight edges These include Hough transforms RANSAC and least square fitting Additionally, unsupervised LiDAR classification techniques have considered the texture of road and nonroad, where man made structures often have smooth, regular height textures, and small height variations, while trees and other vegetation give an irregular height pattern,  using this to separate man made structures, such as roads, from vegetation Driving behaviour is affected by particular features that are not covered in this methodology, namely the delineation of road centrelines and edges The detection of these features is influenced  by either if a road edge is easily detectable, or if a road has painted markings to indicate a centreline, both of which are not observable through this methodology, and would likely rely on mobile LiDAR data collection. This dissertation presents a methodology for the extraction of road features to enable a fuller understanding of the rural British road network. The method presented considers the requirement for supervised classification of roads to determine road width, that utilises existing OS open road data which is freely available. Concentrating on the practical applications of determining road width enables the use of a sampling classification, which reduces computational load, and enables sample based filtering.  Results generally provide insight into the overall road quality of individual roads in relation to each other, but work is required to more accurately extract key features in road quality assessment, particularly road widths. Further development of this method would provide road features for use in a national assessment of rural roads in Britain, to aid with improvements with the understanding of rural accessibility, the response time of emergency services, more appropriate speed limits, and rural road hierarchies.
